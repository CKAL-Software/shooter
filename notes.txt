Add a reaction time. The AI can just know everything happens in the game immediately, but player can't. So in real time games, you must add 100–200ms delays between AI actions.
Imperfect aim. AI can input a perfect angle with 32bit precision, where player are lucky to aim with 12bit precision. In everyday terms the AI can snipe a coin in the moon.
Make random mistakes. If an AI should be easy to beat, make it to randomly do nothing, recruit a suboptimal unit, miss the shot or give a bad order
Keep It Simple and Stupid. No need to make best decision. Just take a decision fast.
No need for artificial networks or genetic AI, unless that is the main feature of the game.
Look at other games about how they do things. Free Open Source games often have enjoyable AIs and made with good ideas.
If you need something more complex than a priority queue for tasks, probably you are overthinking it.
The AI must not know what the same things the player doesn't know. Example: if the player can see the monster health bar, also the AI can know player remaining HPs.
Recycle AI code with parameters. Angry AI will maximize damage doing reckless actions, Careful will act delayed but do balanced decisions, Evil Mastermind will hoard resources before unleashing a total attack. This makes the game much more interesting as player learns different approaches.
Group AI. If player can control a group of units have simple high level commands like “follow me”, “ attack what I attack”, “stay here, dammit”, and “survive”.
Enemy group AI. A cheater way to do good flocking behavior is to choose a leader, have others to follow that leader and stay at random distance from him based on number of units. When leader dies, the nearest becomes the leader.
Basic rock paper scissor AI. If player keeps throwing rock, choose paper more. It is enough to give the illusion of a much bigger intelligence.
There is only one rule at the end, when making games: the game must be fun to play!
